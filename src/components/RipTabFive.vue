            <b>rippleitin.nz</b> is an independant New Zealand based private provider providing server validation of, and information regarding, the xrp ledger.
            <br>
            <br>The <b>XRP Ledger</b> is an open source technology, a decentralized cryptographic ledger, powered by a network of peer-to-peer servers
            that anyone can use and is owned by no one. It is the home of
            <b>XRP</b>, a digital asset designed to bridge the many different currencies in use worldwide.
            <br>
            <br>Here at rippleitin.nz we strive to provide 100% uptime for both the validating and stock node, that the validator is proxied behind, with the network
            suitably firewalled and protected at numerous levels via an Ubiquiti Edge Router 4 and other devices. The network is provisioned through a 1 Gigabit fibre
            connection that has historically provided 99.9% uptime. The servers run monitoring software to ensure sufficient warning of any issues that need attention.
            <br>
            <br>Our aim is to provide above average, up-to-date servers with suitably matched configfurations to ensure our validators votes attain as close
            to 100% of the consensus process as often as possible and that they arrive in a timely fashion, not after the consensus round has completed.
            <br>
            <br>The latest updates to <b>CentOS</b>, and other relevant software, are performed as required and the server's are updated within 12 hours of a new rippled version being released.
            This server runs rippled unmodified.
            <br>
            <br>rippleitin.nz is clearly identifiable on the network providing domain verificatiion, the master public key of the validator, the hosting of a relevant .toml file
            and connects to the network via the <b>dUNL</b> hosted by ripple.com (currently known as the default unl)
            <br>
            <br>First established in Feb 2018, the rippleitin.nz validating node was the in first New Zealand,
            further adding to the decentralised worldwide network of validators, who together form the backbone of the xrp Ledger.
